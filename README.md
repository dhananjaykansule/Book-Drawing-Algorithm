# Book-Drawing-Algorithm
## Overview

This project implements a book drawing algorithm for graph visualization, focusing on minimizing edge crossings in \( k \)-page book drawings. The algorithm takes a graph as input and produces an ordered representation that efficiently utilizes the available pages.

## Features

- **Graph Input**: Supports general graphs, allowing users to input various types of graph structures.
- **Vertex Ordering**: Implements strategies for ordering vertices to optimize edge placement across pages.
- **Edge Ranking**: Assigns rankings to edges based on their likelihood of crossing, aiding in the visualization process.
- **Page Assignment**: Efficiently assigns edges to pages while minimizing crossings.
